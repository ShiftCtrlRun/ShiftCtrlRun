<h1> Hello and welcome to my Profile, here are a few things about me</h1>
<ol>
  <li>My name is Darius.</li>
  <li>I'm a boy.</li>
  <li>I'm currently 19 Years old (20.06.2005).</li>
  <li>I'm from Germany.</li>
  <li>I taught myself a bit of HTML, and I hope learning other Languages won't be so hard either.</li>
  <li>I am currently training to become an information electronics technician. I am in my second year of training. Once I completed this training, I would like to become a full-stack developer</li>
</ol>
<br>That's about it for now - maybe i'll add a few things later on
